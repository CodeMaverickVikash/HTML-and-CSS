 To create a flexbox container and to transform direct in width of flex items,
  use the d-flex class: 

1) Horizontal Direction
Use .flex-row to display the flex items horizontally (side by side). This is default.

Tip: Use .flex-row-reverse to right-align the horizontal direction:

2) Vertical Direction
Use .flex-column to display the flex items vertically (on top of each other), or
.flex-column-reverse to reverse the vertical direction:

3) Justify Content (Deal with horizontally)
Use the .justify-content-* classes to change the alignment of flex items.
Valid classes are start (default), end, center, between or around:

4) Order
Change the visual order of a specific flex item(s) with the .order classes.
Valid classes are from 0 to 12, where the lowest number has highest priority (order-1 is shown before order-2, etc..):
Wrap
Control how flex items wrap in a flex container with .flex-nowrap (default),
.flex-wrap or .flex-wrap-reverse.

5) Align Items (Deal with vertically)
Control the vertical alignment of single rows of flex items with the .align-items-* classes.
Valid classes are .align-items-start, .align-items-end, .align-items-center,
.align-items-baseline, and .align-items-stretch (default).

6) Align Self
Control the vertical alignment of a specified flex item with the .align-self-* classes.
Valid classes are .align-self-start, .align-self-end, .align-self-center, .align-self-baseline,
and .align-self-stretch (default).
